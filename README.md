### Hi there, I'm Juan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a grad from Codeup, a fully-immersive, project based, and intensive 22-week Full-Stack Java Career Accelerator that provides students with 670 hours of expert instruction in software development. With a Bachelor of Business and proven leadership experience. A background in printing and exposure to digital design influenced the decision to seek out a career that combines creativity and technology. Motivated for the opportunity to create programs that assist in the efficiency of producing systems that will help bridge the gap between people and technology. I am interested in connecting to not only expand our network but to share experiences, suggestions and ideas.
